# DocTurn

With the help of DocTurn, you can easily keep track of the status of your documents. You will never again need to sift through your emails in a panic to find out what the most recent version of a document is.

In fast paced environments like a corporate law firm, every second of the day counts. While working as a legal assistant to five lawyers at one of Canadaâ€™s busiest corporate firms, I noticed that my lawyers spent considerable amount of time on version control of documents, which is why I created DocTurn. DocTurn is version control management application that helps keep track of: what documents you are currently working on, what version is the latest, who is currently reviewing it, and when it was last reviewed. This application alleviates a pain point for busy business professionals who review many documents on a regularly basis, and it has easy to use UI for people who don't have the time to learn a new application.
